# Google-Calendar-Alexa-Skill
An Alexa Skill for Amazon Echo by using [Flask-Ask](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask)

With this skill you can connect your **Public Google Calendar** with your Alexa and listen all your `reminders` or `reminders for a specific day`.  
Alexa reads reminder with the following formatting:
```
Day Month Year:
Reminder for start_time to end_time
â€¦.
```
It can also do **auto refresh** when you call the skill again and takes your new reminders.
